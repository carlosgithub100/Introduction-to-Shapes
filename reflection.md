At first, learning about variables was a bit tricky because I had to think about how they all worked together. 
The most challenging part was using random values for both the position and color of the shapes without making everything look chaotic. 
I struggled with getting the circle to move smoothly across the canvas by adjusting its xPos and yPos over time, while also figuring out how to randomly change the color using r, g, and b values without it being too distracting. But once I understood how to track changes, like the speed of movement with changeOverTime, it started to click. Now I can see how using variables makes everything more dynamic and controllable. 
Iâ€™m proud that I got the sketch to look good while still using randomness, which was hard to balance at first.
